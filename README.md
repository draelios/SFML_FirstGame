# SFML_FirstGame

This is a basic project for me to learn how to use the SFML library. Based on the examples found in the book "C++ Game Development By Example Learn to build games and graphics with SFML"

This game will contain basic stuff related to many things in game development suchs as:

<ul>
<li>Basic gameplay loop</li>
<li>Collision detection</li>
<li>Sound effetcs</li>
<li>Basic UI and scoring</li>
<ul>
